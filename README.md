### Inspiration 
The Honey Chrome extension is an excellent app that provides coupons that work 99% of the time, however, the money that is saved is not always used in the best way. We sought to create a chrome extension that puts saved money to good use: through investing. Instead of saving a bit of cash that may be used for an unnecessary purchase, it can wisely be invested to help growth your wealth.

### What it Does
This chrome extension automatically applies coupons to your purchases and invests any money that is saved. Wealth wise automatically applies coupons to your purchases, and when money is saved, that extra change can be invested into a portions of stocks to grow your money. This is done through the use of a web scraper for finding coupons and the plaid API for banking transactions. The user interacts with all of their options through a Google Chrome extension dashboard, and then it hides away until savings are found.

/**
 * This util function should only be used by repos relying on server-side rendering (SSR) with
 * access to a post-build or distribution version of Threads. The type casting here is intentional.
 *
 * We inject a _getCss method to component stylesheets (see the `injectStyleFunctions` plugin in
 * rollup.config.js) to retrieve the post-build CSS output in order to allow repos that rely on
 * SSR (e.g. repos using NextJS) to extract post-build CSS as stylesheets and serve them from the
 * server. This is to primarily address any Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) issues that can come
 * with only using a dynamic load of the Threads library.
 *
 * TODO(aren): Improve upon this method by passing taking a `html` param so that we only return
 * the CSS for classnames.
 * TODO(aren): Include CSS from SCSS-only modules (e.g. Color)
